# "Robots are important also. If I don my pure-scientist hat, I would say just
# send robots; I'll stay down here and get the data. But nobody's ever given a
# parade for a robot. Nobody's ever named a high school after a robot. So when
# I don my public-educator hat, I have to recognize the elements of
# exploration that excite people."
