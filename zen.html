    <p>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</p>
    <div>Beautiful is better than ugly.</div>
    <div>Explicit is better than implicit.</div>
    <div>Simple is better than complex.</div>
    <div>Complex is better than complicated.</div>
    <div>Flat is better than nested.</div>
    <div>Sparse is better than dense.</div>
    <div>Readability counts.</div>
    <div>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</div>
    <div>Although practicality beats purity.</div>
    <div>Errors should never pass silently.</div>
    <div>Unless explicitly silenced.</div>
    <div>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</div>
    <div>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</div>
    <div>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</div>
    <div>Now is better than never.</div>
    <div>Although never is often better than *right* now.</div>
    <div>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</div>
    <div>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</div>
    <div>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</div>
